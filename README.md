## SQLBoiler Benchmarks

### Requirements

This repo requires Go 1.14+ to run.

To regenerate models, a running docker daemon is required.

### Instructions

To run the benchmarks, run: `go test -bench . -benchmem`

To generate the models, run: `./scripts/gen-models`

To benchmark using a different version of SQLBoiler, you can use a module
replacement that points at a local checkout. For example:

```sh
go mod edit -replace github.com/aarondl/sqlboiler/v4=/home/user/sqlboiler
```

Regenerate the models as needed. The model generation script and the code in
this repo will use the replaced SQLBoiler. The same can be done for any other
dependency as needed.

**Note**: There are some ruby and python scripts for generating graphs from
many runs of these benchmarks. They can be used to help update the sqlboiler
README with new graphs.

Graphs can be found in the [SQLBoiler](https://github.com/aarondl/sqlboiler) readme.
